Start a new Node JS project  with ‘ npm init ‘
Install the mongoose and express and  .env
Configure the environment variables with .env
Lunch a server with express in the server.js file
Connect your database locally or with mongo atlas
The Folder structure should be like this :
config/ .env 

Server.js

     7. Create a models folder and a User.js file in it 

     8. In User.js you must define a mongoose Schema and export the model , you will use it in the server.js

     9. The Folder structure should be like this : 

config/ .env 

models/User.js

Server.js

     10. In the server.js create four routes : 

       GET :  RETURN ALL USERS 

       POST :  ADD A NEW USER TO THE DATABASE 

       PUT : EDIT A USER BY ID 

       DELETE : REMOVE A USER BY ID
